# Real-Time Weather Reporting System

ðŸŒ¦ *Project*: Real-Time Weather Reporting System  
ðŸ”¹ *Tech Stack*: Arduino, Arduino IDE, HTML, CSS, XAMPP  

## Overview
This project utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller and a humidity sensor to measure and report humidity levels in real-time. The data collected is displayed on a custom-built website designed with HTML and CSS, providing an intuitive interface for monitoring live weather updates.

## Features
- *Real-Time Data Collection*: Captures and reports humidity levels instantly.
- *Custom Web Interface*: A user-friendly website that displays live weather data.
- *Hardware Integration*: Combines Arduino with a humidity sensor for seamless data gathering.

## Tech Stack
- *Arduino Uno*: Microcontroller for managing the sensor.
- *Humidity Sensor*: Collects real-time humidity data.
- *XAMPP*: Local server for hosting the website.
- *HTML & CSS*: For creating a responsive and user-friendly web interface.

## How It Works
1. The Arduino Uno reads humidity data from the sensor.
2. Data is sent to the server, where it is processed.
3. The custom HTML/CSS website displays live updates.

## Installation
1. *Arduino Setup*:
   - Install Arduino IDE and connect the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the humidity sensor to the Arduino as per the wiring diagram.
2. *Server Setup*:
   - Download and install XAMPP.
   - Place website files in the htdocs folder of XAMPP.
3. *Run the Project*:
   - Start XAMPP and open the website in a browser to monitor real-time humidity data.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more weather parameters (e.g., temperature, wind speed).
- Extend support for remote monitoring via cloud integration.
